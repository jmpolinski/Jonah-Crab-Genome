# Jonah Crab (*Cancer borealis*) Genome 

A reference genome was generated using PacBio CLR and Omni-C data.  
  
Genome assembly and raw sequencing data can be found in NCBI BioProject XXXXX (add link).  

## Sample information 

## Library prep and sequencing
DNA extraction, library prep, and sequencing were performed by Dovetail Genomics, funded by a Revive & Restore Wild Genomes grant. Three PacBio CLR libraries were generated. Libraries were CLR, rather than HiFi, due to difficulties generating additional HiFi libraries. Dovetail Genomics also generated Omni-C data for scaffolding.  
  

## Genome assembly
Both Dovetail Genomics and GMGI (led by J. Polinski) used the above described sequencing data to generate reference assemblies. The final chromosome-level assembly was generated by GMGI. Information on how that assembly was generated and downstream analysis can be found in the subdirectories of this repository.
